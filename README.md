## 🚀 About Me

🎯 I'm a data engineer with hands-on experience designing and deploying **production-ready AI systems**.  
🧠 I specialize in building **RAG architectures**, **vector databases**, and **serverless pipelines** using open-source and cloud-native tools.  
🔁 My background in BI and analytics enables me to bridge business requirements with technical implementation, always aiming for **scalable**, **modular**, and **maintainable** solutions.

My current stack includes:

- ☁️ **AWS** (S3, EC2, Lambda, CloudWatch, IAM, VPC)
- 🔧 **Terraform** (Infra-as-Code)
- 🐍 **Python** (LangChain, Pydantic, FastAPI, asyncio, etc.)
- ⚙️ **Vector DBs**: `Qdrant`, `FAISS`
- 🧠 **RAG systems**: embeddings, retrieval pipelines, prompt orchestration
- 🧪 Observability & Testing: `logging`, `pytest`, `pydantic`, `systemctl` for service orchestration

I’m looking to join teams building **reliable data infrastructure**, where I can contribute with strong software engineering practices — from versioning and CI/CD to monitoring and performance tuning.
